# DAOed BlockStack API helper library

This library contains [BlockStack API](https://core.blockstack.org/) helper functions used in DAOed dapps.

While originally developed for use in *DAOed* dapps, other *BlockStack* dapps might this library handy as it is:
* lightweight
* comes with useful features not found in the official *BlockStack* JS library
* works in the browser, node.js and native(react-native, vue-native, ...)
* well documented
* well maintained and actively used on our BlockStack dapps
* tested(manually) - automated tests coming soon
